make the circle shape-outside on float a bit bigger (or the text smaller)

Hi Alan

Great talk.  One minor suggestion.  For newbies, when first mentioning flexbox, it might be good to say there is no relation to Adobe Flex, since this is a MAX talk.  Just in case someone gets confused

.circle {
  -webkit-shape-inside: circle(50%, 50%, 50%);
}
